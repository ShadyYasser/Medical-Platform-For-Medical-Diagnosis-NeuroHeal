      "Here are the Symptoms of Osteoporosis\n1- Bone Fractures: Increased susceptibility to fractures, especially in the spine, hips, and wrists. Fractures may occur with minimal trauma or even during routine activities.\n \n2-Loss of Height: Compression fractures in the spine can lead to a gradual loss of height over time.\n \n3-Back Pain: Persistent, dull, or aching pain in the lower back, which may be a result of fractures or collapsed vertebrae.\n \n4-Stooped Posture: Changes in posture, such as a stooped or hunched appearance, due to fractures and loss of bone density in the spine.\n \n5-Decreased Grip Strength: Weakened grip strength, which may be an indicator of reduced bone density in the hands and wrists.\n \n6-Receding Gums or Tooth Loss: Osteoporosis may affect the jawbone, leading to receding gums and an increased risk of tooth loss.\n"
